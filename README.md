# Overview
This project converts a song to the corresponding guitar chords and the lyrics. As an intermediate guitar player, I often struggle with learning a song by ear. So, I created a python program that takes in an MP3 file and prints out the chords and the lyrics nicely formatted for me to learn. Try it and let me know how it goes!

## To Run
To use this program, you need the mp3 version of the song. It is recommended that you use the original recording of the song to ensure that the chords sync with the lyrics. 
Usage: -r [duration] or -f [path] or -fl [path] [Song Name] [Artist Name (Optional)]
       -r to record audio, -f to upload file, -fl to upload file and get lyrics
