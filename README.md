## Overview:
This project seeks to be able to identify and output the guitar chords for a given song and mp3 file. As an intermediate guitar players, I struggle to learn songs by ear so I created a program that identifies the chords for me and formats it nicely with the song lyrics. Test it out and let me know if you have any issues!

## To Run
To run this program, you will need the mp3 of the song you want the chords for (the official mp3 file would be best to ensure proper syncing with the lyrics). 
Usage: -r [duration] or -f [path] or -fl [path] [Song Name] [Artist Name (Optional)]
       -r to record audio, -f to upload file, -fl to upload file and get lyrics

## Issues
No known issues as of yet, but please let me know if you find any!
