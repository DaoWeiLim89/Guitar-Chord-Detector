The accuracy at its peak was 91%
For faster processing, hop_length and sr were changed which decreased accuracy.
res_type='kaiser_fast' was also added, wasn't prevkously there for faster processing.
Also removed cens this didnt seem to change accuracy though (was only 0.1 weightage)
for recording_harm, changed margin=8 to 4, kernel_size=15 was added. Accuracy went up overall even though deceptecon dropped?
Window size was also chanaged to adjust for the change in the duration of each frame
